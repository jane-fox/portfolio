# About

A custom theme for my web portfolio. I designered it all on my own, does that make me 


## Using

To get started, cd into directory and use `npm install` to set up tools.

During development use `gulp watch` to watch JS and CSS files and automatically compile them.

If adding new scripts or styles, update the gulp file instead of the standard wordpress enque. I know this isn't the standardad WordPress-friendly way, but I wanted to keep the assets all minified together for the fastest load. 


### Notes

I change the design and content of various parts frequently, so some of the areas are just html inputs, for my convenience.

Requires a few ACF fields for full display. Example export included in source.
