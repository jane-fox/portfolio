# About

Simple theme for my portfolio; based on _s theme.


## Using

To get started, cd into directory and use `npm install` to set up tools.

During development use `gulp watch` to watch JS and CSS files and automatically compile them.

If adding new scripts or styles, update the gulp file instead of the standard wordpress enque, so they all stay minified together for the fastest load.
